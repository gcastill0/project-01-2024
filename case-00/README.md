To configure a trigger in ExtraHop that captures all protocol-specific data fields and sends them to a webhook using the WebHook method, you need to create a trigger script that checks for different protocol events, collects the relevant data, formats it into JSON, and then sends it via an HTTP POST request to your webhook URL.

Below is a step-by-step example that shows how to configure a trigger to capture data for HTTP, DNS, and SSL/TLS protocols and send this data to a webhook.

### Step 1: Access the ExtraHop Web Interface

1. Log in to the ExtraHop Web UI with an account that has administrative privileges.

### Step 2: Create a New Trigger

1. **Navigate to Triggers:**
   - Go to **Settings** > **Triggers** in the ExtraHop Web UI.

2. **Create a New Trigger:**
   - Click **New Trigger** to create a new trigger.

3. **Configure Trigger Details:**
   - **Name:** Give your trigger a descriptive name, e.g., "Export Protocol-Specific Data to Webhook."
   - **Description:** Optionally, add a description of what the trigger does.
   - **Event:** Choose relevant protocol events you want to monitor. Please select `TIMER_30SEC` and `REMOTE_RESPONSE`.

### Step 3: Write the Trigger Script

Here’s an example trigger script that captures data for HTTP and sends this data to a webhook in JSON format:

```javascript
// Define the webhook URL where the JSON data will be sent
const s1_path = "/services/collector/raw?sourcetype=extrahop"

// Check if the event is TIMER_30SEC send hello world
if (event === 'TIMER_30SEC') {

    var jsonData = {
        "message": "Hello Work!"                // Hello Work! 
    };

    // Convert the JSON object to a string
    var jsonString = JSON.stringify(jsonData);

    // Send the JSON data to the webhook URL using an HTTP POST request
    Remote.HTTP("s1_ODS_target").post({
        "path": s1_path,
        "payload": jsonString
    });
}

// If there is a response to the Remote.HTTP via REMOTE_RESPONSE
if (event === 'REMOTE_RESPONSE') {
    var rsp_body;
    if (Remote.response.body) { rsp_body = Remote.response.body.toString() }
    debug("Status Code: " + Remote.response.statusCode.toString() + "\n" + rsp_body)
}
```

### Step 4: Save and Assign the Trigger

1. **Save the Trigger:**
   - After entering the script, click **Save** to save your trigger configuration.

2. **Assign the Trigger:**
   - You need to assign the trigger to the relevant devices, protocols, or other criteria where you want it to be active. This is done under **Assignments** within the trigger configuration page.
   - Choose the devices or protocols (e.g., HTTP, DNS, SSL/TLS) that the trigger should monitor.

### Step 5: Test the Trigger

1. **Generate Test Traffic:**
   - To ensure the trigger is working correctly, generate some network traffic for HTTP, DNS, and SSL/TLS protocols that matches the trigger’s criteria.

2. **Check Webhook Destination:**
   - Verify that the webhook endpoint is receiving the JSON data correctly. You can use tools like `RequestBin` to create a temporary endpoint for testing purposes and see the data being sent.

### Step 6: Monitor and Adjust

1. **Monitor Trigger Performance:**
   - Keep an eye on the performance of the trigger in the ExtraHop Web UI to ensure it is capturing and exporting data as expected.
   
2. **Adjust as Needed:**
   - Based on your observations, you may need to adjust the trigger script, filter specific transactions, or modify the JSON structure to meet your needs better.

### Summary:

This example trigger script captures protocol-specific data fields for HTTP, DNS, and SSL/TLS protocols and sends the data to a webhook in JSON format. The script checks for each protocol event, constructs a JSON object with the relevant data, and sends it to the specified webhook URL, including an authorization token for secure access. You can modify the script to include other protocols or customize the fields as needed.
